If you want to include instructions for running your Django project using Docker, you can add a section to your README file specifically for Docker setup and usage. Here's how you can extend the README file to include Docker instructions:

```markdown
# Django-REST-API 

Description of your Django project .

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Docker installed on your local machine 

## Docker Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://git.rubico.tech/RubicoTech/rocketrecall-ppuflashcardapp-python
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a Docker image for your Django project:

   ```shell
   docker build -t your-project-name .
   ```

## Usage with Docker

1. Start a Docker container for your Django project:

   ```shell
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name your-container-name your-project-name
   ```

   - `-d`: Detached mode (runs in the background).
   - `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 from the container to your host machine.
   - `--name your-container-name`: Assign a name to your Docker container.
   - `your-project-name`: The name of the Docker image you built.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` to access the Django application running inside the Docker container.

3. To access the Django admin panel, go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

## Configuration

You can customize the project's settings in the `settings.py` file as usual.

## Deployment

For deploying your Django project using Docker in a production environment, consider using orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Create a production-ready Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration for your project.
